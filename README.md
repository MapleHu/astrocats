# Supernova Light Curve Catalog #

This is a repository of supernova light curves, currently maintained by James Guillochon. The catalog is displayed in tabular form on [sne.space](https://sne.space). Individual event data can be downloaded by click the "Source" link on the left and downloading the .dat file associated with a given event; however it's probably easier to use the search function on the table displayed on [sne.space](https://sne.space) to find the event you're looking for.

## Contributing Data ##

If you have a historical archive of data that likely won't be updated, feel free to [e-mail your data directly to me](mailto:jguillochon@cfa.harvard.edu) and I'll do the hard work of converting it to the standard format. However, if you are an active observer and will add data all the time, I prefer to have people [fork the repository](https://bitbucket.org/Guillochon/sne/fork) and update/add events that way. This also allows observers to keep event data "private" in their fork until they are ready to add it to the repository.
